# C for Arduino

A sequence of simple sketches for illustrating the C programming language on the Arduino.

1.  Testing with `if`:
    <%= simplesketch1a/simplesketch1a.ino =%>
2.  Repeating things with `for`:
    <%= simplesketch1a/simplesketch1b.ino =%>
3.  Defining a `function`:
    <%= simplesketch1a/simplesketch1c.ino =%>
4.  Using C++ objects:
    <%= simplesketch1a/simplesketch1d.ino =%>
5.  Using datatypes like `float`:
    <%= simplesketch1a/simplesketch1e.ino =%>
